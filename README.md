## Overview

Shield Insurance is designed to transform how insurance data is analyzed and presented. By leveraging Power BI, 
this project provides interactive dashboards and custom reports delivering real-time insights and improved decision-making capabilities.

## Provided feature list:

1)To begin, we would like to focus on understanding the number of customers we have and the total revenue we are generating. It would also be beneficial to track the daily revenue growth rate and daily customer growth rate to monitor our progress.

2)Monitoring changes in policies on a month-over-month basis is also important to identify trends and areas for improvement. It would be helpful to segment our customer base by age group and analyze revenue and customer numbers by city and age group.

3)To analyze trends in customer and revenue growth over time, it would be great to create a switch between revenue trend graphs and customer trend graphs. Additionally, using filters to analyze sales mode, age group, city, month, and policy ID would make the analysis more efficient.

4)It would be valuable to have a separate page for sales mode analysis to better understand our customer demographics. We can calculate total customers and total revenue split percentages by sales mode, and analyze the trend of sales mode over the month.

5)Having a separate page for age group analysis would also be helpful to understand the impact of age groups on our business. We can analyze age group data to understand expected settlement, sales mode, and policy preference, which will help us make informed business decisions.

## Term which I learned:

1) Base coverage amount
2) Base premium amount
3) final premium amount
4) settlement %

## Term which I use:

1) DAX like calculate, sumx, averagex, all, allexcept, distinctcount
2) function like isblank(), selectedvalue(), previousday(), previousmonth(), sameperiodinlastyear(), divide().

## Tools Which I use:

1) DAX measures
2) Power Query Editor
3) Data modeling
4) Calculated Column
5) Calculated Table

## Key Insights:

- Customer wise the biggest rise happened on 10 Dec 2022 and lowest on 19 Dec 2022.
- Revenue wise the biggest rise happened on 25 Feb 2023 and lowest on 27 Feb 2023.
- Customer and Revenue wise the top growth for the month happened in March and minimal in April.
- Highest revenue is coming from Delhi NCR and lowest from Indore.
- Sales mode like offline agent is more beneficial  for us.
- A persons whose age from 31 to 40 takes more policy and highest revenue is coming from this age age group

## Recommendation:
- Focus on analyzing the factors that led to the significant increase in customers
- Replicate  strategies like month march during other periods to maximize customer growth.
- Understand the factors contributing to the lowest revenue of April month.
- Invest more resources in the Delhi NCR region as it generates the highest revenue.
- Develop targeted strategies to boost sales in Indore.
- Since offline agents are more beneficial, consider expanding your network of offline agents. Provide them with additional training, resources, and
  incentives to further enhance their effectiveness.
- Consider developing new policy or services specifically designed to meet the needs
